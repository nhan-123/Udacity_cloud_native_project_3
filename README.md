## Verify the monitoring installation

*TODO:* run `kubectl` command to show the running pods and services for all components. Take a screenshot of the output and include it here to verify the installation

## Setup the Jaeger and Prometheus source
*TODO:* Expose Grafana to the internet and then setup Prometheus as a data source. Provide a screenshot of the home page after logging into Grafana.

## Create a Basic Dashboard
*TODO:* Create a dashboard in Grafana that shows Prometheus as a source. Take a screenshot and include it here.

## Describe SLO/SLI
*TODO:* Describe, in your own words, what the SLIs are, based on an SLO of *monthly uptime* and *request response time*.  
A Service-Level Objective (SLO) is a measurable goal set by the SRE team to ensure a standard level of performance during a specified period of time.  
A Service-Level Indicator (SLI) is a specific metric used to measure the performance of a service.  
For example, suppose that your team has the following SLO:  
The application will have an uptime of 99.9% during the next year.  
In this case, your SLI would be the actual measurement of the uptime. Perhaps during that year, you actually achieved 99.5% uptime or 97.3% uptime. These measurements are your SLIs—they indicate the level of performance your service actually exhibited, and show you whether you achieved your SLO (in this case, the SLIs show that performance fell short of your objective).  

## Creating SLI metrics.
*TODO:* It is important to know why we want to measure certain metrics for our customer. Describe in detail 5 metrics to measure these SLIs. 
The average 20x responses of the web application is 97.99%.  
Incoming request that are had 40x are 1%
The average of incoming requests is 600ms  
The average of CPUs is 50%  
The avarage of Ram is 300Mib  

## Create a Dashboard to measure our SLIs
*TODO:* Create a dashboard to measure the uptime of the frontend and backend services We will also want to measure to measure 40x and 50x errors. Create a dashboard that show these values over a 24 hour period and take a screenshot.

## Tracing our Flask App
*TODO:* We will create a Jaeger span to measure the processes on the backend. Once you fill in the span, provide a screenshot of it here. Also provide a (screenshot) sample Python file containing a trace and span code used to perform Jaeger traces on the backend service.  
- ![default ns](/Screenshots/jaegerspan1.png)
- ![default ns](/Screenshots/jaegerspan2.png)
- ![default ns](/Screenshots/trace_backend.png)
## Jaeger in Dashboards
*TODO:* Now that the trace is running, let's add the metric to our current Grafana dashboard. Once this is completed, provide a screenshot of it here.
- ![default ns](/Screenshots/trace_backend2.png)

## Report Error
*TODO:* Using the template below, write a trouble ticket for the developers, to explain the errors that you are seeing (400, 500, latency) and to let them know the file that is causing the issue also include a screenshot of the tracer span to demonstrate how we can user a tracer to locate errors easily.

TROUBLE TICKET

Name: Can't to connect database

Date: 2023-01-01 22:11:19.731

Subject: Can't to connect database 

Affected Area: on file backend-app.py

Severity: Medium

Description: issue with database connection on star endpoint 

## Creating SLIs and SLOs  
The uptime of web application is 97.99% per month.   
More than 95% request should be successfull per month.  
The average of CPUs is less than 80% per month.  
The avarage of Ram is 300Mib per month.  

## Building KPIs for our plan
* The average 20x or 30x responses of the web is more than 95%  
Monthly uptime - this KPI indicates the total usability of the application.  
20x code responses per month - this KPI indicates availability of the pages of the application.  
Monthly traffic - this KPI will indicate the number of requests served by the application.    
* The uptime of web application is 97.99% per month.
Average monthly latency - this KPI will indicate the time it took for the application to respond to requests.  
Monthly uptime - this KPI indicates the total usability of the application.  
Monthly traffic - this KPI will indicate the number of requests served by the application.  
* The average of CPUs is less than 80%.  
Average monthly CPU usage of pod used by the application - this KPI will indicate how much CPU is used by the source pod of the application.  
Average monthly CPU usage of all the pods - this KPI will indicate how much CPU is used by all the pods required to run the application.  
Monthly quota limit - this KPI will indicate whether the application is exceeding its usage of the CPU quota.  
* The avarage of Ram is 300Mib.  
Average monthly memory usage of pod used by the application - this KPI will indicate how much memory is used by the source pod of the application.  
Average monthly memory usage of all the pods - this KPI will indicate how much memory is used by all the pods required to run the application.  
Monthly quota limit - this KPI will indicate whether the application is exceeding its usage of the memory quota.  

## Final Dashboard
- ![default ns](/Screenshots/Final_Dasboard.png)
Uptime Backend - The time of backend application works  
Uptime Frontend - The time of frontend application works  
CPU usage - Total CPU use in each Pods  
Memory Usage - Total RAM use in each Pods  
20x - Total request will be had a response with status 20x  
40x - Total request will be had a response with status 40x  
50x - Total request will be had a response with status 50x
